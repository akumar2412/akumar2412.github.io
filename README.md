# Anuj Kumar
Hello, I am a Ph.D. student at Indiana University Bloomington working under the supervision of Michael Jolly and Vincent Martinez (CUNY Hunter College). I work in the field of partial differential equations, especially in problems related to fluid dynamics and turbulence.

to the generalized SQG equation in critical Sobolev spaces, Communications in Mathematical 
Physics, 387(1):551â€“596, 2021. [DOI 10.1007/s00220-021-04124-9](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00220-021-04124-9.pdf).

2. M.S. Jolly, A. Kumar, and V.R. Martinez, On local well-posedness of logarithmic
inviscid regularizations of generalized SQG equations in borderline Sobolev spaces,
